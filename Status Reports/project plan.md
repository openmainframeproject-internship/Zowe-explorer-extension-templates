**Student's Name:** Muhammad Ali

**Mentor:** Daniel Kelosky

**Project:** Zowe Explorer Extension Templates

**Project Description:** We will build a Zowe CLI plug-in that will use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to connect to and get data from [Zowe Sample API service](https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/blob/master/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring/README.md) and then build a VS Code Extension on top of the built Zowe CLI plug-in

**Problem Definition:** Template of Zowe Explorer Extension in JSON format

**Deliverables**

**Coding Plan**

| Week | Tasks | Goals |
|------|-------|-------|
| Week 1| Initial meeting| Introductions(get to know each other) |
| Week 2 | Discussion on Github and the fundamentals of Javascript, Typescript and Node.js | Get familiar with the technologies to be used in the project  |
| Week 3 and 4 | Build a VS Code extension, Run a web service using Node.js and discuss node package manager, package.json and jest |To have the tatse of how the VS Code extension is generated and get to know some packages of the NodE.js|
| Week 5 | Discussion and description on the High level steps to follow to complete the project : web service, Building a Zowe CLI plug-in which will connect to a web service and then build a VS Code extension on top of the plug-in |Steps to follow|
| Week 6 | Develop a Zowe CLI plug-in(Diff) and Build and run the Zowe REST API SDK | New Zowe CLI plug-in |
| week 7 | Work on documenting the design for the project |Complete the midterm deliverables|
| week 8 |modify the Developed Zowe CLI plug-in to use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to connect to the Zowe sample API service| To have the Zowe CLI plug-in that will use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to connect to the ["Zowe Sample API service"](https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/blob/master/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring/README.md)|
|Week 9| Identify and resolve any runtime errors in the Plug-in or between the plug-in and [cURL](https://curl.se/) | Ensure the plug-in gets data from ["Zowe Sample API service"](https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/blob/master/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring/README.md)|
| Week 10 and 11 |Build a VS Code extension on top of the modified Zowe CLI plug-in and do all testings| Ensure that the generated Zowe VS Code extension use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to connect and get data from a REST API in ["Zowe Sample API service"](https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/blob/master/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring/README.md) and bring back response to the User in JSON format |
| Week 12 | Complete the documentation for the project, create the project presentation and video demonstration | Complete the mentorship|
